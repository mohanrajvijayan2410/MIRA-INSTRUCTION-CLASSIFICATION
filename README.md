# üß† **Instruction Classification**

## üìú **Project Overview**
This project involves training and deploying a BERT-based model to classify following instructions types into predefined categories. The system uses a Flask-based front end to allow users to input new instructions and get real-time classifications.

    Simple instruction
    Instruction with Sequence
    Instruction with Options
    Mandatory Instruction
    Instruction with Goal
    Instruction with Reason
    Negative Instruction
    Non Instruction


## üìä **Dataset**
- **Primary Dataset**: `wikihow.csv` containing instructions classified into 6 different categories.
- **Test Datasets**:
  - **NCERT Data**: Contains academic-style instructions.
  - **TNSB Data**: Includes practical, step-based instructions.
  - **Pixel_help Data**: Comprises technical instructions for device usage.

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Model Architecture**
Two models were trained:
1. **Binary Classification Model**: Determines whether a text is an instruction or not.
2. **Multi-Class Classification Model**: Categorizes instructions into one of six classes.

### Training Details:
- The models were trained using the `wikihow.csv` dataset.
- After training, the models were saved as `.pt` files for easy access by the Flask backend.
- The frontend allows users to input instructions, and the backend classifies them using the trained models.
