This project is used to check the classification of instructions utilizing a simple interface. 

This project is an flask application.


The project consists of, 

        1. "new model" folder: Contains the fine tuned BERT model that is trained for classification of instructions under 7 categories. 
        2. "templates" folder: Contains the html file for the frontend, "check.html".
        3. "app.py" : This program is the flask application.


Use this command to install the neccessary modules

        pip install torch transformers flask

To run the flask application,

        1. Run the program in Visual Studio code inside the Test directory.
        2. Open command promt,
                change to the working directory, Test (eg. "C:\Projects\Test" or "E:\Test").
                Run the python program using "python app.py" command or "flask run" command.

A flask server is created on the address: "http://127.0.0.1:5000" , you can open this address on a browser to access the frontend
         
Overview: 
        This flask application transfers the data from the frontend and passes it to the model
        The model then predicts the classification and sends it to the flask application.
        The flask application then transfers it to the frontend and display it in the format of table.


Note: Make sure no other flask application is running before executing this program
